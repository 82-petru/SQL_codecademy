--World Population 
-- You'll work with a dataset of world population by country data from recent years, two tables: population_years and countries  
population_years contain id primary key, population, year, country_id 
countries contain id primary key, name country, continent

-- get a  felling with tables containtment
SELECT * FROM countries LIMIT 10;
SELECT * FROM population_years LIMIT 10;

--how many entries are in table from Africa?
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM countries WHERE continent = 'Africa';

-- what was the total population of the continent of Ocenia in 2005
SELECT SUM(population) FROM population_years JOIN countries 
ON population_years.country_id = countries.id WHERE continent = 'Oceania' AND year = 2005; 

-- what is the average population of countries in South America 
SELECT AVG(population) FROM population_years JOIN countries 
ON population_years.country_id = countries.id WHERE continent = 'South America' AND year = 2003; 
-- practice, check a left join

SELECT Count(*) FROM population_years JOIN countries 
ON population_years.country_id = countries.id;

SELECT Count(*) FROM population_years LEFT JOIN countries 
ON population_years.country_id = countries.id;

-- what country has the smallest population?
SELECT name, MIN(population) AS 'population_million' 
FROM population_years JOIN countries 
ON population_years.country_id = countries.id WHERE year = 2007;

-- what is the average population of poland during the time period covered by this datasheet?
SELECT name, AVG(population) FROM population_years JOIN countries 
ON population_years.country_id = countries.id WHERE name = 'Poland';

-- how many countries have the word 'The' in their names?
 SELECT COUNT(*) FROM countries WHERE name LIKE '% The%';

-- what was the total population of each continent in 2010?
SELECT continent, SUM(population) AS 'population'
 FROM population_years JOIN countries 
ON population_years.country_id = countries.id 
WHERE year = 2010 
GROUP BY continent ORDER BY 2 DESC;
