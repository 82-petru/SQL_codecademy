-- lets have a felling about the containtment of the tables
SELECT * FROM trips;
SELECT * FROM riders;
SELECT * FROM cars;
-- what's the priamry key of trips, riders and cars?
-- id is the primary key for every table 

--Try out cross join between riders and cars is the result useful? NO
SELECT riders.first, cars.model FROM riders CROSS JOIN cars;

-- create a Trip Log with trips and its users find the join between trips and riders and then combine the two tables LEFT JOIN 
SELECT * FROM trips LEFT JOIN riders ON trips.rider_id = riders.id;

-- suppose we want to create a link between trips and cars used during those trips, find the columns to join both tables by using OINNER JOIN
SELECT * FROM trips JOIN cars ON trips.car_id = cars.id;

-- stack the riders table on top of the new table named riders2
SELECT * FROM riders UNION SELECT * FROM riders2;

-- what is the average cost of the trip?
SELECT AVG(cost) FROM trips;

-- find all  the riders who have used REBU less than 500 times 
SELECT * FROM riders WHERE total_trips > 500;

--calculate the numbers of cars that are active 
SELECT * FROM cars WHERE status = 'active';

-- write a query that finds the car with highest trips_completed
SELECT * FROM cars ORDER BY trips_completed DESC LIMIT 2;
